# Test Controller setup for standby/resume
#
Initial Conditions:
  SPIBOOT_N:		1	# Indicates UniPro should be used
  e-Fuse preload:	Yes	# Load from the E-fuse data file
  VDDSDIO:		1.8v	# No STIO interface power at startup
  Boot Bridge:		Yes	# Release Boot Bridge from reset at atartup
  Server Release:	Yes	# Release Serever (other) Bridge from reset at atartup
  MPHY Connection:	2-lane	# No UniPro link active

Operations:
  Assert GPIO20
  De-assert GPIO3,4,5,23
  Power ON Server Bridge
  Release RESET on Server Bridge
  Wait the UniPro link up
  Power ON Boot Bridge
  Release RESET for Boot Bridge
  Bridge Handshake
  wait until PWROFF_N == 0
  wait 2ms
  De-assert GPIO20
  assert GPIO_3
  wait 40us
  deassert GPIO_3
  Bridge Handshake
  Simulation Finish
